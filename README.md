This project was made to try out HTML/CSS with sinatra-rb.

When you visit the website it will show a nice UI and a textbox. Next, you enter a URL into the textbox and click submit.
This sends a POST request to the server and generates a HTML button with a randomly generated hexidecimal colour* . I haven't completely thought it through yet, but the idea is that each website has it's own unique colour and it will be used like a barcode. As I say, I haven't thought it through, but the project was mainly just to test out making nice looking websites.
